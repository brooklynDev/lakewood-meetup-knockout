##Lakewood Web Developer Meetup - Knockout Demo

This is the sample application I coded at the meetup. To get started, make sure you have `Ruby` installed on your machine. Then, from the command line just clone the repo:

```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:brooklynDev/lakewood-meetup-knockout.git
```

Then from the root of the application, just start the server:

```bash
    rackup
```

You can now navigate to `http://localhost:9393/`. 

There are two versions of the app, you can access the `jQuery` version at: `http://localhost:9393/jquery-version` and the `knockout.js` version at: `http://localhost:9393/knockout-version`.
